Acme::Currency version 1.00
===========================

Why confine yourself to using the American Dollar as scalar-context
sigil? There's a few currencies out there and in the age of
internationalization and Unicode, there is no reason not to use them
for our evil purposes.

This module uses a source filter to replace every occurrance of a given string
in the source code with the $-sigil. That means using the @ in place of the
Yen symbol should yield interesting arrays. (Or none at that.)

By default, using Acme::Currency will use the € character as the scalar sigil.
